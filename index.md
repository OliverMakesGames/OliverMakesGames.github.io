## Lost Animals: A Wholesome Farming Adventure

  Lost Animals is a charming and engaging single player video game that allows players to experience the joys of running their own virtual farm. Set in a colourful and whimsical world full of secrets, the players will plant crops, raise adorable animals, heal their environment, and create a thriving rural paradise. The game falls within the casual and farm-simulation genres, targeting a broad audience of players who enjoy relaxing gameplay experiences or imagine a world where we can be more connected to our work and the land we live on. The project scope aims for a compact yet immersive game that provides hours of entertainment.
